'''
basically recurion but with specific applications
    recursion is one thing, over and over, working towards one base casea

recursive backtracking -
    is many potential solutions 
    base case is one potential solution, itll create trees worth of solutions
    initial call begins with an empty solution 

    one potential pattern: choice -> explore -> unchoose
        if that potential choice makes a base case return true
    
    used for 3 types of problems
        1. generate all possible solutions
            two recursive calls (like fibonacchi)
                - has an option
                - doesnt include that option 
        
        2. make sure there exists at least one solution
            make a choice 
            explore that choice recursively 
            if good, then good ... if unsuccessful, then unchoose

        3. find a best possible solution


    youll track options to consider and choices made (which starts empty)
