Lecture 23: Linked Lists
    - A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements
    - Each element is a node that contains a value and a reference to the next node
    - The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail, 
    - typically you can only access the head and follow the list to the tail
    - a nodes typehint is Optional['Node'], because it can be either a node or None
    - data type in a linked list is a node, referenced by self.head
        - self.head when its an empty list would be None.. best way would be Optional['Node']
    - each node has two pieces of information, the value and reference to the next node
    - to access the next node you call self.next
    - the type of self.next is Optional['Node'] which means it'll be node or none
    - the last reference will be None
    - some methods would be:
        - add: add a node to the front of the list
        - append: add a node to the end of the list
        - pop: remove the first node from the list
        - search: search for a value in the list
        - get_item: get the value at a specific index
        - size: get the number of nodes in the list
        - is_empty: check if the list is empty
        - __len__: get the number of nodes in the list
        - __str__: get a string representation of the list
            you could write this str(2, 3) == "2 -> 3"
        - __contains__: check if a value is in the list
            you could write this contains(2, 3) == False
        - __eq__: check if two lists are equal
            you could write this eq(2, 3) == False
    - nodes are NOT data structures
    - __str__ is better than str because it allows you to print the object directly
    - to add to my linked list, I would create a new node with the add methods and set the next node to the current head, the eastiest is the head
    - the benefit of linked lists over lists are that you can add and remove elements in constant time
        - also with linked lists each node has its own spot in memory and doesn't have to be contiguous
        - the downside is that you can't access elements by index
        - you would use linked lists over regular when


    FOR UML DIAGRAMS:
        the diamond means (has a)
        the arrow means (is a)
